# Room Activity Tracker

## Project Description

The Room Activity Tracker project aims to monitor and track activities within a room using various sensors and visualization techniques. This Java-based application provides real-time updates and graphical representation of the room's activity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the project, you need the following:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA for running the Java application

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PadmalathaKasireddy/room-activity-tracker.git
    cd room-activity-tracker
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Ensure the `RoomAnimationGUI.java` file is in the `src` directory.

4. Run the `RoomAnimationGUI.java` file from your IDE.

## Model Training

Since this project focuses on activity tracking within a room using Java, there is no machine learning model training involved. The application relies on predefined logic and sensor inputs to track and visualize room activity.

## Results

The application provides real-time updates and graphical representation of the activities occurring within the room. You can see visual animations and logs that indicate different types of activities detected by the sensors.
